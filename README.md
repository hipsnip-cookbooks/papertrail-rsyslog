Description [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hipsnip-cookbooks/papertrail-rsyslog.png)](https://travis-ci.org/hipsnip-cookbooks/papertrail-rsyslog)
===========
A simple cookbook for setting up a server to stream logs into Papertrail via a secure
TCP connection.

> NOTE: While it is fully functional, this cookbook is no longer being actively worked on.
If you're interested in taking over, please do get in touch!


Requirements
============
Built to run on systems with Rsyslog installed. Tested on Ubuntu 12.04


Attributes
==========

    ['papertrail']['port'] = The Papertrail log destination port number (required)
    ['papertrail']['host'] = The Papertrail host address (defaults to logs)
    ['papertrail']['syslog_selector'] = The syslog tags and types to stream into Papertrail (defaults to "*.*")
    ['papertrail']['resume_retry_count'] = The number of times to retry the sending of failed messages (defaults to unlimited)
    ['papertrail']['queue_disk_space'] = The maximum disk space allowed for queues (default to 100M)
    ['papertrail']['enable_tls'] = Whether to encrypt all log traffic going into Papertrail (default to True)
    ['papertrail']['certificate_src'] = The URL of the certificate file on the Papertrail server
    ['papertrail']['certificate_checksum'] = The sha256 checksum for the Papertrail certificate file


Usage
=====
First, make sure you set the ['papertrail']['port'] attribute in your Role/Environment,
to the destination port created in Papertrail. Then include the `papertrail::default` recipe
in you run list to start streaming all syslog entries to Papertrail.


### Tailing log files
This functionality is currently not available, but will be provided via the Opscode Rsyslog cookbook
(included as a dependency), where there is an open pull request for it at the time of this writing.
